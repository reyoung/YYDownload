{"name":"YYDownload","tagline":"tool download youku video","body":"# YYDownload\r\nYYDownload is (intended to be) a collection of application and tools parsing video site URL to downloads URLs, like parsing \"http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNTExNzI5MDI0.html\" to many URLs of flv files. It is written by scala and run on any platform which support jvm (Desktop(linux, windows, mac), Android). It will contains three application. YYCli, YYDesktop, YYDroid. The develop status of this project is still very early stage.\r\n\r\n## Why I want to develop these tools?\r\n\r\nThere are many very good tools or application to parse or download video of Youku, Youtube, etc, like [flvcd](http://www.flvcd.com), [youget](http://www.soimort.org/you-get/), but they are:\r\n* don't support any phone OS\r\n* either don't contains cli interface nor desktop interface\r\n* dodn't support subscribe video list\r\n\r\nSo I want to refine these. At least, I want to write a tools that good enough for me.\r\n\r\n## Develop Status\r\n\r\nCurrently, The \"youku\" video can be parsed and downloaded by a simple CLI program.\r\n\r\n## Develop Plan\r\nFirstly, I will develop and refine a cli version of my program. These version would be able to parse only one video site, youku.\r\n\r\nThen, I will develop an phone version. It can subscribe video list, subscribe user, automatic download/remove video.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will (maybe) develop a desktop version.\r\n\r\n## User Document\r\n\r\nThere are few document for user:\r\n\r\n* YYCli Documents: [YYCli.md](https://github.com/reyoung/YYDownload/blob/master/doc/YYCli.md|doc/YYCli.md)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
